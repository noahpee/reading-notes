# Learning CSS

### Applying basic CSS to a wireframe

In this lesson we covered applying basic CSS to HTML elements, some of the useful attributes I used were:

-     margin: 0 auto; - this centers a div
-     overflow: scroll; - this means content that does not fit will be scrollable
-     margin: auto; + display: block;  - this centers an image inside of a div

I created a centered website with a scrollable section from a wireframe for this excercise.

I have also implemented CSS using a href as well as in the HTML tags. We used a refresh.css file to override the browers presets.
