# Wireframe-Demo

### This is a basic wireframe for a website.

It uses placeholder images from two different sources:
- https://via.placeholder.com/0x0.png?text=image
- https://placekitten.com/0/0

*you can change the height and width by editing the numerical values, you can change the alt text by editing the text after the '='.*

Some of the html elements that go inside < > are:

- "header" this is the header element
- "body" all elements that are displayed go inside the body tags
- "nav" this is the navagation element
- "ul" this is an Unorganised List inside the nav element 
-  "img" this is an image tag
-  "p"  this is a text/paragraph tag
- "div" this is a division, it helps to define groups of elements
- "footer"  this is the footer element 
- "a" this is a hyperlink element inside the list
- "link" this links the CSS sheet
